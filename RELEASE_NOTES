Mostly docs. Changes since 00-00-04:

- Document:
  * Methods for determining the energies of muons in simulation at arbitrary points
  * List of available flux parameterizations 
- Add:
  * Generation probability parameterizations for the CORSIKA configurations used
    in IC79 (previously private to my thesis work, but that's done now)
  * Muon flux parameterizations from DPMJET, split into conventional and prompt
    components (ditto)
- Remove built-in copy of boost::numpy, and instead use Martin Wolf's enhanced
  version (when available)
  -- Jakob van Santen

- Remove built-in copy of the weighting project in favor of the official one.
- Remove relative imports for Python 3 compatibility.
  -- David Schultz

Added release notes for this project. Enhancements and bugfixes since 00-00-03:

- Add an axial cylinder sampling surface for use in NeutrinoGenerator
- Add pybindings for I3MuonGun::GetDepth() and fix up argument order in
  EnergyDistribution
- Fix up various incompatibilities with Python 2.4 and 3
- When choosing intersection points with a cylinder, allow up-going tracks to
  intersect the bottom cap (reported by chaack)
- Fix a sign error in the projected area term for cylinders. This was important
  for extremely long cylinders. (reported by cweaver)
- Check down-track distances of stochastic losses by distance rather than time
  in Track
