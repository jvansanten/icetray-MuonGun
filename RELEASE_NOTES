Added release notes for this project. Enhancements and bugfixes since 00-00-03:

- Add an axial cylinder sampling surface for use in NeutrinoGenerator
- Add pybindings for I3MuonGun::GetDepth() and fix up argument order in
  EnergyDistribution
- Fix up various incompatibilities with Python 2.4 and 3
- When choosing intersection points with a cylinder, allow up-going tracks to
  intersect the bottom cap (reported by chaack)
- Fix a sign error in the projected area term for cylinders. This was important
  for extremely long cylinders. (reported by cweaver)
- Check down-track distances of stochastic losses by distance rather than time
  in Track
